	<div class="head-sub"> Impact of Technology on Our Lives</div>
	<p class="home-text">Hello! As you may have noticed, nowadays technology plays a significant role in our lives,
		 simplifying everyday tasks, improving communication, and providing access to an infinite amount of information.
		Thanks to technology, I can stay connected with friends and family regardless of the distance of thousands of kilometers,
		 quickly find answers to any questions, and efficiently solve various tasks.

	<div class="arm"> <img class="arm" src="arm.jpg"> </div>
	<div class="head-sub1">Emerging Technological<br>Horizons</div>
	<p class="home-text1"> We are currently witnessing rapid technological advancements in various fields,
		 and I feel a great interest in their future development.
		 I believe that technologies will change our lives,
		  providing us with new opportunities and solving complex problems.
	</p>
	<div class="head-sub2">Pursuing My Dream as<br>a Biotechnologist</div>
	<p class="home-text2"> My dream is to become a biotechnologist because this field combines my two favorite subjects:
		 computer science and biology. I feel a strong calling to research and utilize technologies in the field of biotechnology. 
		 Just imagine how we can use technology to address medical issues, study genetic diseases, and grow organs in the lab.
		 I see immense potential in this field and want to be part of the innovations that will change the world.

	<div class="head-sub4">What are those areas?</div>
	<p class="sub4-text1">Cloning<br>Among the various areas of biotechnology, I am particularly interested in cloning.
		Cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of a living organism or its part using its genetic material.
		It can be beneficial for research, medicine, or species preservation. 
		For example, cloning can help grow identical plants or create animals with specific characteristics.
	</p>
	<div class="clone-gif"><img class="clone-gif" src="clone.gif" alt="GIF Image"></div>
	<p class="sub4-text2">Organ Cultivation<br>Another area that fascinates me is organ cultivation.
		 Organ cultivation involves creating living organs in laboratory conditions for transplantation into the human body.
		 This can assist patients who require organ transplants but do not have access to donor organs. For instance, 
		 growing skin, hearts, or kidneys can help save lives and improve people's quality of life.
	</p>
	<div class="org-gif"><img class="org-gif" src="heart.gif" alt="GIF Image"></div>
	<p class="sub4-text3"> Prosthetics and Neural Interactions<br>Prosthetics, specifically prostheses 
		that interact with the nervous system, currently interest me the most. Prostheses that interact with the nervous system 
		transmit signals between the brain and the replacement device, enabling individuals to control the prosthesis through their
		thoughts or sense touches and movements through the nervous system, bringing prosthetics closer to natural body interaction.
	</p>
	<div class="arm-gif"><img class="arm-gif" src="prosthesis.gif" alt="GIF Image"></div>
	<div class="head-sub5">The Interplay of Computer Science and Biology</div>
	<div class="home-text5">It should be noted that without computer science this field would not exist at all. At first glance, biotechnology may seem solely
		related to biology, but in most cases, only the outcomes are showcased, while computer science plays a significant role in all the research, design, and
		programming aspects of biotechnology. It may seem that these two sciences do not blend but biotechnology has proven otherwise.
	</div>
	<div class="head-sub6">Infinite Challenges and<br>Achievements</div>
	<div class="home-text6">However, it's important to remember that new professions emerge each year due to the rapid development of technology. Therefore, I believe 
		there might be a profession in the future that will resonate with me even more.
	</div>
	<div class="head-sub7">Driving Positive Changes through Technology</div>
	<div class="home-text7">My future with technology will be filled with challenges and unforgettable achievements. I believe that technology will become an integral
		part of my professional development and personal life. While there are certain ethical and safety concerns, I am confident that the responsible use of technology
		can lead to positive changes and significant accomplishments.

	<p class="hi">Hello!</p>
	<p class="about-text">My name is Ilona Pilypenko. I'm 15 years old, and I'm from Ukraine. Currently, I am studying at Gravitas School.</p>
	<p class="about-text">For three years, I studied at the Richelieu Scientific Lyceum in the chemistry-biology class, and for one and a half years out of those three,
		I studied at two schools simultaneously. I have always been interested in computer science and biology. My passion for research and my desire to change the world through technology led me to
		consider biotechnology as a possible future career. I also enjoy learning new things, which is why I am currently learning to write IT code. At the moment, I have a basic knowledge of programming
		languages such as C++ and Python.
	</p>
	<p class="about-text">Regarding my achievements, I participated in a competition organized by NASA, where I developed an interesting project. Additionally, at the Richelieu Scientific Lyceum, we worked on many projects aimed at solving various problems.
	</p>
	<p class="about-text">Apart from my scientific interests, I love reading, learning languages, draw and I also engage in playing tennis.

				<summary class="accordion-title">Do you think technology will bring people closer together or drive them apart in the future?</summary>
				<p class="accordion-text">In my opinion, it's hard to say for certain because it will be similar to the present situation where people seem to communicate less in the real world, but with the help of technology, we can stay connected with anyone, anywhere.</p>
			</details>
			<details class="accordion-item">
				<summary class="accordion-title">What did you want to be when you were a child? </summary>
				<p class="accordion-text">When I was a child, I dreamed of becoming a singer, but over time, I realized that I enjoyed learning and discovering new things more than creating music.</p>
			</details>
			<details class="accordion-item">
				<summary class="accordion-title">What advantages do you see in the combination of technology and biology?</summary>
				<p class="accordion-text"> I see limitless possibilities in this combination. Biology has always been relevant as an integral part of studying everything around us, while computer science only became relevant in the past century. But in such a short period of time, it has become an integral part of creating new things. Despite the difference, I see an incredible connection that links us as humans with technology, and if everything develops correctly, an incredible and exciting future awaits us.</p>
			</details>
			<details class="accordion-item">
				<summary class="accordion-title">Did you have teachers or mentors who influenced your interest in science and technology? How did they inspire you?</summary>
				<p class="accordion-text"> Yes! I had an exceptional biology teacher who captivated everyone with his enthusiasm for the subject. He did everything to spark our interest. I have to admit that he succeeded!) </p>
